# Technical analysis and the London stock exchange testing the MACD and RSI rules using the FT30

## Abstract

This article examines two oscillators – the Moving Average Convergence– Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) – to see if these rules are profitable. Using 60-year data of the London Stock Exchange FT30 Index, it is found that the RSI as well as the MACD rules can generate returns higher than the buy-and-hold strategy in most cases.
